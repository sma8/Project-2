	<h3>AAA Testing</h3>
	<p>AAA stands for arrange, act, assert. It is a good way to structure a test. Doing tests are important because it will show if the functions are running properly or not. The first step, arrange, should set up the test. The second step, act, should "cover the main thing to be tested", such as calling a function. The third and final step is assert which is finding the outcome and seeing if the test passed or not. </p>
