	<h1>Docker Hub and Docker Desktop</h1>
	<a href="index.html">Return to Main Page</a>
	<div>Docker is a platform used to build and run images from <br>
		applications. Docker Desktop is a program that is used <br>
		to run those images as containers. Multiple containers with <br>
		databases can also be used to persist data on the containers. <br>
		Docker Hub is used to host the images in repositories, which <br>
		can be used with Azure to run the image as a container online.<br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div>
		In order run an app through Docker, a <b>Dockerfile</b> (with no <br>
		file extension) needs to be made. This file creates the image <br>
		that works with Docker. The following code is used in our Dockerfile: <br>
		<pre>
		<code>
		FROM httpd:2.4
		COPY ./public_html/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
		</code>
		</pre>

		A <b>docker-compose.yml</b> file also needs to <br>
		be created, which determines the version, type of image to use, <br>
		the port to run the image on, SQL user and passwords for MYSQL, <br>
		and much more. The following is in our compose file: <br>
		<pre>
                <code>
                version: "3.2"
		services:
  		  apache:
    		    build: . 
    		    ports:
      		      - "8080:80"
    		    volumes:
      		      - ./public_html/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
                </code>
		</pre>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div>
	When an application is ready to be built on Docker, you use the line <br>
	<code>docker build -t tagname .</code> <br>
	The -t gives the specific build a tag, which you use in place of "tagname". <br>
	The dot "." at the end specifies which directory to use in the building process. <br>
	Since we use a dot, it picks the current directory you are in. <br>
	After this, we can run the image on Docker Desktop using the line: <br>
	<code>docker run -dp 8080:80 tagname</code><br>
	The d and p flag run a new container for the image and map it to the port specified, <br>
	which in this case is 8080:80. The "tagname" specifies which build to run. Sure enough <br>
	Docker Desktop will then have a new container running the app you have just created.
