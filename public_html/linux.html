	<h2>Why should we use Linux Commands?</h2>
	It's important to know how to use Linux Commands, since many products,<br>
	like phones, computers, and fridges use Linux in some manner. Many of <br>
	the things that can be done with UI buttons can also be done using the <br>
	commands listed previously. Nothing needs to be downloaded to utilize <br>
	these features. Everything is included, and knowing the commands can <br>
	help you create programs faster, without having to leave the terminal <br>
	you are working on. <br>
