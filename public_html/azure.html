	<h1>Microsoft Azure</h1>
	<a href="index.html">Return to Main Page</a>
	<div>
		Azure is a cloud based platform used to host millions <br>
		of products and websites, including this very page! <br>
		As stated on the Docker page, Azure can be used with <br>
		Docker in order to host the images on the cloud, so <br>
		anyone can visit or view whatever website or application <br>
		you created. In order to do so, first you login to azure <br>
		in your terminal using the command: <br>
		<code>docker login azure</code><br>
		Once logged in, you can create an ACI context, which will <br>
		allow you to run the images on Azure. You use the command: <br>
		<code>docker context create aci aciname</code><br>
		This creates the ACI context "aciname", which you can rename. <br>
		Then we run the following command to create a container instance: <br>
		<code>docker --context myaci run -dp 80:80 dockerhub-username/dockerhub-repo</code><br>
		The context flag tells the terminal to use that context, and the dockerhub <br>
		username and repo name is what Azure uses to build its container instance. <br>
		You can switch the context and view your containers with the following: <br>
		<code>docker context use aciname</code><br>
		<code>docker ps</code><br>
		You should be able to see an address before the port, in this case <br>
		"80:80". Pasting this into your browser will allow you to view <br>
		your webpage or app online. <br>
