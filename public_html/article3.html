	<h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
	<p>There are four principles of object oriented programming (OOP). They are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p>
	<p>Encapsulation: restricting access to methods which stops data from being modified. Ex. calculator class.</p>
	 <p>Inheritance: class inherits properties from another class Ex. Addition and subtraction class inherit properties from calculation class </p>
	<p>Polymorphism: using common interface for different data types </p>
	<p>Abstraction: showing what's neccesary Ex. users seeing calculator history</p>
